# DvS Discord Bot

### This is a private bot which has now been made open-source and free to use for developers to come up with their own creations!

###### This bot uses PostgreSQL as a database, and uses GPORTAL private API and WebSocket for events and requests. You can set the GPORTAL refresh token using the /token command on the bot - the rest of the authentication will be handled from there. I recommend using an alternative GPORTAL account to prevent deauthorizing yourself.

###### The src/util/RCEManager.ts file is the main file where the GPORTAL (Rust Console Edition) stuff is handled.

###### Feel free to explore the rest of the source-code, it may not be perfect but it can certainly give developers an idea of how to come up with your own creations.
